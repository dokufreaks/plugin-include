Hey I know this is off topic but I was wondering if you knew of any widgets I could 
add to my blog that automatically tweet my newest twitter updates.

I\'ve been looking for a plug-in like this for quite some time and 
was hoping maybe you would have some experience with something like 
this. Please let me know if you run into anything. I truly enjoy reading your blog and I look forward to your new updates.
